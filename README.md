VizQuest Hackathon – Complaint Risk and Resolution Monitor

🏆 Hackathon Winner – VizQuest by Envision (1st Place)
This repository contains the Power BI solution that won the VizQuest Data Hackathon hosted by Envision.
Our project focuses on uncovering financial complaints in the USA across different products including credit card, student loan etc. using the CFPB Consumer Complaint database.

👥 Team
This project was built collaboratively by our hackathon team:
Nikhil Gajula, Sruthi Ravi, Avis Le, Andres Fernando

🚀 Project Overview
Consumers across the U.S. file millions of financial complaints every year.
Our objective was to understand:
“Where do consumers face the most financial friction, and how does geography influence complaint density, delays, and severity?”

Using two years of CFPB complaint data, we built an interactive multi-page Power BI dashboard that reveals patterns in consumer issues, operational performance, and fairness indicators across states.


🔍 Key Features:
📊 Comprehensive Power BI Dashboard with 4 analytical pages
🌎 Geographic analysis of complaints by state
📈 Operational performance metrics such as average response time & delay rates
⚖️ Fairness indicators like complaints per 100k population
🏦 Banking access insights using normalized metrics
🔎 Product- & issue-level deep dives
🧽 Cleaned & modeled CFPB dataset using Power Query + DAX

🧱 Dashboard Pages
Executive Overview: KPIs, YoY%, complaint volume, product distribution
Product: Issue hotspots, sub-issue patterns, performance metrics about each different product
Geography: Maps, complaint density, state rankings
Team members: List of team member names

🛠 Technology Stack
CFPB Consumer Complaint Database – primary dataset
